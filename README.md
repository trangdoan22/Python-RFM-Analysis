# RFM Analysis

**1. What Is Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM)?**

- RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary) is a part of Marketing Analysis which used to analyze Customer Value, thereby helping companies to analyze each customer group products, from which there are marketing campaigns or special care.

- The RFM model is based on three quantitative factors:

  + Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase
  + Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase
  + Monetary value: How much money a customer spends on purchases

 **2. Context**

SuperStore Company is a global retail company having a lot of customers.
At Christmas Eve and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers for supporting company during the past time as well as exploit potential customers to become loyal customers.

The Marketing Department asked the Data Department to assist in implementing a segment classification of each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group, they also proposed using the RFM model.

The Data Department need to:
- Make a segment classification of each customer based on 3 indexes (R, F, M)
- Analyze the current situation of the company and give suggestions to the Marketing team
- Give recommendation which index should be most interested in in the 3 R, F, and M indexes?
